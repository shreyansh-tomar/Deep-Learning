# Deep-Learning
This repo contains all the completed,upcoming projects related to Deep Learning

All the project uses Jupyter NoteBooks. 
Some projects are Developed in Google Colab Enviornment(**Free Cloud Service based on Jupyter Notebooks that supports FREE GPU** *How Cool is that!!*).

## Getting started with Google Colab
Colab is ideal for many things from improving your Python Skills to working on *deep learning libraries* like PyTorch, Keras, Tensorflow and OpenCV. Also, it's very easy to use like Very Easy. Creating notebooks, sharing notebooks, mounting your Google Drive, connecting your GitHub, connecting to your local PC or Hosted Runntime and Use notebooks stored in the above mentioned categories and also saving a copy of notebook after you finish your task is just a click away. It's Awesome.

### Anaconda on a local machine with GPU can also used to train and run the model
