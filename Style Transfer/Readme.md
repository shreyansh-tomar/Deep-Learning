# Introduction

Implemented the [Neural-Style algorithm](https://arxiv.org/abs/1508.06576) developed by Leon A. Gatys, Alexander S. Ecker and Matthias Bethge. 
Neural-Style, or Neural-Transfer, allows you to take an image and reproduce it with a new artistic style. The algorithm 
takes three images, an input image, a content-image, and a style-image, and changes the input to resemble the content of 
the content-image and the artistic style of the style-image.
